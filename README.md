# Project2
For this project, we created a "staycation" app or 'StayKay' that allows a user to lookup events in their locale based on their interests/time available.

AS A person going on a 'staycation',
I WANT a way to lookup things to do and places to go in Philadelphia,
SO THAT I can enjoy my time off and well deserved relaxation.
